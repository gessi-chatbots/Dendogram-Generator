I would very much like access again so I can ask and answer questions on this vital topic.","reviewId":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.02175426483154297,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02174091339111328,"feature":"UninstalledDiscord","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"Uninstalled discord."},{"extractionTime":0.023206233978271484,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.023192644119262695,"feature":"RestartPixel","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_1","sentimentData":null,"text":"Restarted my pixel 7a."},{"extractionTime":0.021683454513549805,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.021669864654541016,"feature":"ReinstallDiscord","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_2","sentimentData":null,"text":"Reinstalled discord."},{"extractionTime":0.02299332618713379,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.022979259490966797,"feature":"FindFix","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_3","sentimentData":null,"text":"Didnt find a fix via google or known discord bugs."},{"extractionTime":0.025536775588989258,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.025523662567138672,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_4","sentimentData":null,"text":"Still cant get several subchannels in the server to react to a click."},{"extractionTime":0.02523064613342285,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02521657943725586,"feature":"LoadContent","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_5","sentimentData":null,"text":"When they do, they open but don't load content 99% the time."},{"extractionTime":0.02310323715209961,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02308964729309082,"feature":"SeeBlankChannel","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_6","sentimentData":null,"text":"I just see a blank channel."},{"extractionTime":0.02292776107788086,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02291584014892578,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_7","sentimentData":null,"text":"Very frustrating as one of the subchannels is mine."},{"extractionTime":0.02187800407409668,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.021866321563720703,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_8","sentimentData":null,"text":"It focuses on disaster preparation."},{"extractionTime":0.025220870971679688,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02520585060119629,"feature":"LikeAccess","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"cd183104-13a6-48f7-9eb1-e24ee35fa0d8_9","sentimentData":null,"text":"I would very much like access again so I can ask and answer questions on this vital topic."}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"New update makes the interface laggy, even after a reinstall, reboot, you name it.

Hope this problem will be resolved soon.","reviewId":"c1c79a88-09fc-467e-b523-7df6462697e7","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.021707534790039062,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.021695375442504883,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c1c79a88-09fc-467e-b523-7df6462697e7_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"The app is great overall."},{"extractionTime":0.028603315353393555,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02858877182006836,"feature":"StreamGame","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c1c79a88-09fc-467e-b523-7df6462697e7_1","sentimentData":null,"text":"The only problem is when I'm streaming game and sharing the screen with my friends, if I switch to the game, they can't hear my voice, but I can hear their voice."},{"extractionTime":0.022788286209106445,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.022774696350097656,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c1c79a88-09fc-467e-b523-7df6462697e7_2","sentimentData":null,"text":"The problem disappeared if I switched back to the Discord app."},{"extractionTime":0.025400161743164062,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.025385618209838867,"feature":"UseAndroid","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c1c79a88-09fc-467e-b523-7df6462697e7_3","sentimentData":null,"text":"Both of me and my friends use Android, and the version is up to date."},{"extractionTime":0.01987290382385254,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.019860267639160156,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c1c79a88-09fc-467e-b523-7df6462697e7_4","sentimentData":null,"text":"Hope this problem will be resolved soon."}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"It logs me out my account and it just sucks!","reviewId":"deb44b28-5e67-4c16-94ab-e28d8bff21ea","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.022962331771850586,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.0229489803314209,"feature":"LogAccount","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"deb44b28-5e67-4c16-94ab-e28d8bff21ea_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"It logs me out my account and it just sucks!"}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"New mobile update won't let me download audio files anymore","reviewId":"0bdf9856-fab2-4c26-af3b-5a22edd96c84","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.022928237915039062,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02291417121887207,"feature":"DownloadAudioFile","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"0bdf9856-fab2-4c26-af3b-5a22edd96c84_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"New mobile update won't let me download audio files anymore"}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"Would've been really nice if I didn't need to re-loggin every time I change areas.

And the issue persists after a complete reinstall of the app. Buggy, unreliable, but good when it occasionally works.","reviewId":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.024985074996948242,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.024972200393676758,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"As much as I rely on Discord on PC, the mobile app is completely unreliable."},{"extractionTime":0.023226022720336914,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.023211956024169922,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b_1","sentimentData":null,"text":"Ever since Nitro was introduced, the UI has gotten progressively worse."},{"extractionTime":0.02653813362121582,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.026524066925048828,"feature":"OpenApp","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b_2","sentimentData":null,"text":"I frequently have to force close/re-open the app because the keyboard field glitches out or outright refuses to appear."},{"extractionTime":0.02575087547302246,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.025738000869750977,"feature":"LeaveText","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b_3","sentimentData":null,"text":"A new bug on the recent update leaves the text I submitted to a board in the text field."},{"extractionTime":0.022924423217773438,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.022911548614501953,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b_4","sentimentData":null,"text":"And the issue persists after a complete reinstall of the app."},{"extractionTime":0.022621631622314453,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.022608518600463867,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"c222928b-5c7a-4101-a872-dc2bba4a089b_5","sentimentData":null,"text":"Buggy, unreliable, but good when it occasionally works."}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"please have a \"switch account\" feature on mobile \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc","reviewId":"dc149fb5-cd0b-4c00-8e68-baed4af7de9d","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.024762392044067383,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.024748563766479492,"feature":"HaveSwitchAccountFeature","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"dc149fb5-cd0b-4c00-8e68-baed4af7de9d_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"please have a \"switch account\" feature on mobile \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc"}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"kupal no backround music in stream kneega","reviewId":"22ea0c77-adce-4275-8298-ba87ac0e682a","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.022701740264892578,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.022687911987304688,"feature":"KupalBackroundMusic","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"22ea0c77-adce-4275-8298-ba87ac0e682a_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"kupal no backround music in stream kneega"}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"Its personaly a great app Ican use it during te gaming and I also can use it for talking to friends so it personally a very useful app for me and my whole team.","reviewId":"d660a749-87bb-4732-9c50-613e37ddc038","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.027933597564697266,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.02792048454284668,"feature":"","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"d660a749-87bb-4732-9c50-613e37ddc038_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"Its personaly a great app Ican use it during te gaming and I also can use it for talking to friends so it personally a very useful app for me and my whole team."}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"Cash and nico","reviewId":"0ba35491-3f77-4905-bd18-42a77ccf3299","sentences":[{"extractionTime":0.022190332412719727,"featureData":{"extractionTime":0.022177457809448242,"feature":"Cash","languageModel":{"modelName":"transfeatex"}},"id":"0ba35491-3f77-4905-bd18-42a77ccf3299_0","sentimentData":null,"text":"Cash and nico"}]},{"extractionTime":null,"review":"Look, it's a great thing to have to chat with but one problem is that I don't understand why accounts only last for 2 years...
