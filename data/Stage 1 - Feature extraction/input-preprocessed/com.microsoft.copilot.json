However, I've noticed significant improvements over time. I appreciate that our feedback has led to new features. Here are a few more suggestions: - Add a button to switch to dark mode. - Clarify which AI model this update of Microsoft Copilot uses, so users can better understand its capabilities. - Enable chat pinning. Overall, I'll give it a 10 out of 5.",

Copilot can take up to about 10k chars, which means I can paste massive texts and chat about them. Image generation is relatively quick, and high quality. Talking with Copilot is always a blast. Your MS acc. age has to be at least 18 for you to use Copilot, fyi, which is odd. I hope they keep it great",

Sure they added a voice, which is uncanny and creepy, sure they made it seem more like a natural conversation, but otherwise it is broken. They have removed the models ability to search the web, which is a huge issue. It cannot pull current data, so it makes it a less usable Google assistant. They are now using a Microsoft proprietary LLM and not GPT, which I find to be very inaccurate in precision tasks like coding.",

Unfortunately it's nearly unusable at all since the audio forces itself onto my nearest Bluetooth device (in my case, my smartwatch). Disabling Bluetooth still makes the conversation go through the phone's earpiece like a phone call. It's supposed to be a copilot, not a friend. Lol. This should just be a different app entirely, and bring back the last version.",

I uploaded a small file for writing enhancement and financial charts, and the app promised it would take a couple of hours to finish, claiming it was “putting final touches.” Three days later, it’s still unchanged. Each time I checked, the app estimated another 2 to 4 hours. It’s astonishing how Microsoft has trained an AI to waste people's time with vague updates. My document is still exactly the same. All I got was frustrating delays—this is what Microsoft AI has become,",
