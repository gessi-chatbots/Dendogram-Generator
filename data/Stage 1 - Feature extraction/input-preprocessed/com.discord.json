However, it would help if there would be an option to not show gross emoticons (poop; vomit) for those of us heavily sensitive to such imagery (they upset my stomach from merely glimpsing). Mentioning such a difficulty in a large community has some users decide to do it much more, and it's not stuff moderators care about.",

I miss when it was js plain simple colours that matched our pfps, for the love of god change it back (js this one thing....)",

I can't send messages unless I restart the app, can't screenshare or stop screensharing without spamming the button, I get trapped in certain channels, at one point my messages were sending multiple times and staying in my typing box, and so much more.

If you see this message install the app and if it doesn't work for you just rate the app, so discord will notice our reviews and why they're app becoming less rated in the playstore.

If Discord is open, the app will hang and not move to who you want to send your photo/video, link, etc to.

I asked for help before hand and the only thing they told me was to do things I already tried like restarting the app and my phone. Then they told me to go email them. I did.

Reinstalling doesn't fix anything, and there are so many crashes, it's random if chatting to someone will crash the app. Discord utterly hates android.",

Now they got the nerve to lower the free upload size from 25MB to 10MB so for us to pay. Even basic stuff like edit banners is behind a pay wall. We need a competition app to rival Discord so people can leave Discord and go there, to force this company to listen to the consumers. Sadly that the only way these big companies will listen is when they lose their numbers.",

Then when i give my email and phone number then it says that my password is wrong but that password is shown correct in every other apps i have logged in. This is a very serious problem now. This is why i am forced to delete discord. I liked discord very much but due to this problem i can't get my old account back and also i can't make a new accounts because it tells me the same problem over again. I am not downloading it ever again",

Basic features like search range from disgracefully buggy to entirely broken. I've stopped trying to report bugs or give feedback, because nothing ever improves. In October 2024 they literally put banner ads in, but because they're called \"Quests\" they don't list the app as \"contains ads\" in the Play Store. Such honest folks!",

I shouldn't need to clear the cache of an app to work normally for a couple of hours. and it's only gotten worse. maybe it's just my phone, maybe it's just androids, but the amount of bugs is appalling.",

Whenever I try to open a video it just buffers nonstop and takes ages to watch a 40 second one, with pictures it gets glitchy too, if I open it, it just doesn't load. Don't get me started on the video calls!!! They are the WORST! Camera stops/freezes, the audio becomes robotic... It's nearly impossible to have one sometimes, even with a good connection! -Wish we could change the notification tone for contacts and servers so they sounded differently",
