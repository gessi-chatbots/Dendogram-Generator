        "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 950 million active users.\r\n\r\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\r\n\r\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\r\n\r\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \r\n\r\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \r\n\r\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \r\n\r\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\r\n\r\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \r\n\r\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\r\n\r\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\r\n\r\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

They tie your account to your phone number, that's all great if you're not travelling or havnt lost access to your phone number, no alternative access method given like any sensible platform, that's just idiotic , don't use platforms where there ceo has been arrested",

Like seriously what's going on with Telegram. It was one of the best apps but now it's turning out to be the worst. Hope the security and privacy of the users are well maintained without any faults and harm. Hope this helps to change the settings of the app",

                "review": "Telegram seems very fast with mobile data. Texts are quick & Calls have been clear & haven't dropped yet. Telegram is a very simple app to use & I love the lockout screen to keep wandering fingers out. As long as Telegram is truly encrypted & secure, then your corrupt government won't know your business. Update: Telegram is still fast, but i can't sync my contacts as of 10-4-2024. Syncing freezes or crashes & trying to contact support is a joke cause they don't reply, so I'm giving 2 stars.",

No one says anything nor the reason for the ban. No prior warning or anything. Just a ban. Three members in our airdrop community had the same issue just yesterday. And many others . Months of tapping gone down the drain. Telegram stars spent on in-game activities all wasted. Please I wish the telegram support staff could do a better job with responses",

I came back to use the official one, but it seems the bug is back. Two different phones, same bug, 4 years gap.",

When persons who are not in my contacts send me a msg, I don't see the msg, only if I add their number or saved the number in saved msgs, firm press on it to send a msg, I'll see that they had send me a msg in the past. Weird bcz I won't know who sends me msgs & not like I have the option to say who can send me messages, that option is in premium subscription.",

I've tried reaching out to you guys in your support line and your volunteer center, but nobody has told me of anything or responded to any of my questions, and I have been trying since at least the 15th of September. I can't get the bubbles to work at all for the app. It just crashes the app and then I just sigh. The app is fine other than this issue, and it might be isolated, but I had to say something about the poor customer support.",

The good thing about Telegram app is the self censorship. Other than X it's the only app left free from mainstream censorship. I know this is a double edged sword but there's an option to report illegal channels to admins and they'll take them down. The crypto payments they're trying to integrate are cool too. I definitely won't be uninstalling this anytime soon.",

But when Hamster Kombat listed, I was verified again to know if I'm a human. I lost the sell of my $HMSTR at good price. I can't understand. Isn't my selfie sufficient? Do robots take selfies?",

I initially downloaded the app to stay in touch with family, but I was disturbed to find that many channels promote inappropriate content, including graphic videos. It often feels like a platform that hosts content unsuitable for everyday users. The lack of effective content moderation is alarming. If you are looking for a safe and family-friendly messaging app, I strongly advise against downloading Telegram. There are better alternatives out there",
